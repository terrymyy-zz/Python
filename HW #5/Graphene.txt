Graphene: Nanotechnology material to solve all future problemsGraphene is a pure carbon material with strong tensile strength, rapid heat transfer characteristic, and the best electrical conductor known to man. 

For example, graphene is about 100 times stronger than steel, and twice as fast at conducting than copper. Graphene has all these properties because graphene is two-dimensional, displays a bipolar transistor-effect, a ballistic transportation of charges, and large quantum oscillations. 

In addition, graphene is a crystalline allotrope of carbon with a regular bonded atomic-scale hexagonal - chicken wire - pattern. 

Even though scientist knew the properties of graphene, graphene was impossible to produce, and isolate because graphene is chemically unstable when exposed to air. 

However, two researchers - Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov - were successful at isolating graphene at the University of Manchester in 2004.  

The researchers produced graphene by extracting single-atom-thick crystals from bulk graphite with adhesive tape. Since then, more innovative approaches have been used to produce graphene.
